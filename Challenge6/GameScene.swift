//  Make some targets big and slow, and others small and fast. The small targets should be worth more points.
//  Add “bad” targets – things that cost the user points if they get shot accidentally.
//  Make the top and bottom rows move left to right, but the middle row move right to left.
//  Add a timer that ticks down from 60 seconds. When it hits zero, show a Game Over message.
//  Try going to https://openclipart.org/ to see what free artwork you can find.
//  Give the user six bullets per clip. Make them tap a different part of the screen to reload.
//  Those are just suggestions – it’s your game, so do what you like!
